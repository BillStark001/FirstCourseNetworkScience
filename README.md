## Abstract

Networks pervade all aspects of our lives: networks of friends, communication, computers, the Web, and transportation are examples we experience daily, while networks in our brain and cells determine our very survival. The network is a general yet powerful way to represent and study simple and complex relationships. Today, a basic understanding of network processes is required in job sectors from marketing to technology, from management to design, and from biology to the arts and humanities. This textbook is designed to introduces networks to a broad audience of undergraduate students from informatics, business, computer science and engineering, information science, biology, physics, statistics, and social sciences. After surveying networks in many areas, the book talks about the properties of social networks and the key role of hubs. Directed and weighted networks are discussed using the Web and the spread of information and misinformation in social media as case studies. The final chapters cover the more advanced topics of networks models, communities, and dynamics. No technical mathematical or programming background is required, making the book feasible for introductory courses at any level, including network literacy and programming literacy courses. However, the book includes optional technical sections for more advanced students. Programming tutorials, exercises, and datasets allow readers to gain and test their understanding through hands-on activities for building and analyzing networks.
